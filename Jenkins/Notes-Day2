Jenkins Day 2:
=============================

#  sudo su -

# systemctl start Jenkins

Go to AWS --> copy the new public ip of the server

go to browser --> publicip:8080

login with username = admin, password=admin

You will observer Jenkins dashboard is very very slow--> the reason is Jenkins system settings is having old Jenkins URL - we have to be update it with current Jenkins url

Go to Manage Jenkins -> go to system --> scroll down to Jenkins URL --> give the current jenkisn url --> and Save 

Now Dashboard will be fast

==========================================

Demo1: Integrate Jenkins with Maven build tool


Jenkins--> Manage Jenkins-->TOOLS


scroll down to maven Installations => click on add maven

Type name as ==>  mymaven and check the install automatically box.

Save the changes


==========================================
Job Package Job
***************************

Go to jenkins--> new item--> Name= Package==> freestyle project
==> source codemanagement==>select git==> give git repo name https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsClassCodes
 
build steps ==> invoke top level maven target==>mymaven

 goal = clean install package

==> save==> build now
==> click on build number and see the console

==> go to workspace ==> target/addressbook.war

========================================

Pipeline code:
====================================

pipeline{
    
    agent any  // here any = current available ec2 server where jenkins is installed
    
    tools{
        maven 'mymaven'
    
    }
    
    stages{
        
        stage('Checkout Code')
        {
            steps{
                git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Compile Code'){
            steps{
                echo "compiling the code...."
                sh 'mvn compile'
            }
        }
        stage('Test code'){
            steps{
                echo "testing the code using maven surefire"
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        
        stage('BuildCode'){
            steps{
                echo "generating artifact..."
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        
    }
    
    
    
}



It is always important to maintain the pipeline code in Version control tool
It is not a best practice to write the pipeline code in Jenkins server

The pipeline code in VC tool is always written in a file called as Jenkinsfile

This file has no extension. Preffered name of the file is Jenkinsfile.

We will maintain this file in a GitHub repository
Everyone who has access to the repository can now make changes to the pipeline code

As a devops engg--> you will create a Jenkins job 
--> that will connect to the repo and obtain the jenkisnfile --> run the pipeline code written inside it.
