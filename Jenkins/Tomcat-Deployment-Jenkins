# apt install tomcat9 tomcat9-admin -y


Open the server.xml file and change the connector port of tomcat

Scroll down to the Connector port tag as shown below and change port number to 9090.

 




Save the file


Update user information for tomcat

# vim /etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml

Scroll to the bottom of the file and just above the end tag </tomcat-users>

  paste the below line

<user username="tomcat" password="password" roles="admin-gui,manager-gui,manager-script"/>




There should not be any space before the line





Save the file (:wq!)

Open this script

# vim /usr/libexec/tomcat9/tomcat-locate-java.sh

Updating the script this way adding the version 21 is solving the issue :
