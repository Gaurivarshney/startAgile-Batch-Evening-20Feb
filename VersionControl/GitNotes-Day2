Create a new file --> commit on it

touch resetdemo
git add .
git commit -m "added a new file resetdemo"

Make some small modification on the file --> commit on it
Make some small modification on the file --> commit on it
Make some small modification on the file --> commit on it
Make some small modification on the file --> commit on it
Make some small modification on the file --> commit on it

Which mean I will have a very length git commit history

Every small change I have committed it

We always want a clean and crisp commit history

Git says, you can RESET your commit history

   that means:
     > we can Change the HEAD of the log
     > we can delete commit ids
     > we can move the changes from LR to Staging area
     > we can move the changes from LR to Working area
     > we can also permanently delete commits and changes in 
LR and working directory

the command is : git reset <commit id>

What is it that we have to reset, > we want to reset the HEAD to the given <commit id>

#  git reset d573778

So what about the commits before the given the <commit id> --> they will get deleted

So what about the changes we did as part of those commits?

=============================
Observation: 
 > In the git log, the commit history is reset -> all the commits which are above the given <commitID> get deleted
 > Now the HEAD is the  <Commitid> given in the command
 > All the changes of the deleted commits will also be permanently deleted



# git log --oneline

Select the commit id which is at the bottom of your log.



# git reset --hard <commit id>

Example : git reset --hard 04f432e
